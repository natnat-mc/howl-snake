# Howl-snake
A simple snake game as a Howl bundle

This game is played on a 15x grid rendered using an `ActionBuffer`, and handles input using the position of the cursor.
To start playing, use the `:snake` command. The game ends when you die or when you close the buffer.

Honestly, this has no real purpose, and was just written to demonstrate the fact that you can do basically anything with a Howl bundle.
